### What I'm Currently Working On ⭑‧₊˚⋅๋💻‧₊˚⋅⭑
I am currently a Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellow at Cornell University and am focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. Through this program, I am expanding on my Python skills as well as utilizing various libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and spaCy. Alongside these skills, I am also gaining familiarity with Jupyter Notebook. Upon completion of the summer course and receiving the Machine Learning Certificate from Cornell, I will have the opportunity to apply the skills learned to work on a real-world project for one of the many industry partners of the program.
