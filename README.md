### My mission
As a Computer Science student pursuing minors in Data Science & Global Health with a foundation in Biomedical Engineering, I am passionate about the intersection of technology and healthcare. My academic background in Biomedical Engineering provided insight into healthcareâ€™s challenges, and my industry experience has allowed me to apply my technical skills to real-world medical device projects. Iâ€™m particularly interested in using machine learning, data analytics, and AI to improve diagnostic accuracy, personalized medicine, and overall healthcare delivery. Iâ€™m driven by a love for solving problems! My mission is to bridge connections, empower collaboration, and tackle real-world challenges that make a meaningful difference.
